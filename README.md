# Frappeless (no color neovim theme that's actually good)
Catpuccin-Frappe fork but without any highlight

## Installation
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
```lua
{ "kkkfasya/frappeless.nvim", priority = 1000 }
```
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```vim
Plug 'kkkfasya/frappeless.nvim'
```

## Usage
```
:colorscheme frappeless
```

### Roadmap
1. cleanup unused code
2. options to change background color (although the default looks amazing but you people always want to change something)

> this needs a lot of cleanup since there are a lot of unnecessary code, but it's working now!
